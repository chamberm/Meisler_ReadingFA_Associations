# Meisler_and_Gabrieli2021
Code used in Meisler and Gabrieli 2021

This repository includes the code used to preprocess the neuroimaging data, segment white matter tracts, perform tractometry, and compare cohort characteristics. The preprocessing and white matter segmentation is agnostic to the data set. That is, it can be run on **any BIDs** compliant dataset with T1w and diffusion data. The tractometry and cohort characteristic code is tailored to work with a HBN phenotypic query, but can be adapted to work with a custom file.
